# RedditPanel

This is the frontend for a free alternative to other Reddit post automation apps, RScheduler.

To self-host, this will need to be connected to the backend (which you can also find the source for on my GitHub profile), which will then need to be connected to some kind of SQL database following the table style provided in the backend's User.java class.

Backend uses Reddit's OAuth system to authenticate users and add their accounts to the user selector and handles post automation/scheduling.
